    '''Makes the platform_names on the Sample model human readable.

    We were removing spaces from rnaSeq samples' platforms, which made
    them unfriendly to users. This reverts the platform names to the
    original that didn't have spaces in them.

    We do this by munging the platform name on both the Sample object
    and the list of rnaSeq platforms so that they are comparable, then
    if they match we set the Sample.platform_name to what the list had
    originally.

    We can't import the Sample model directly as it may be a newer
    version than this migration expects. We use the historical version.
